## Fake News Debunker

The Fake News Debunker is an interactive tool designed to help users determine the authenticity of news articles. By leveraging advanced AI models, this tool can analyze a news article's title and content to predict whether the news is real or fake. In cases where the article is classified as fake, the tool provides helpful fact-checking suggestions to guide users towards verifying the information.

This application uses a combination of pre-trained language models and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract important keywords from the news content. It then utilizes a state-of-the-art fake news classification model to make predictions. In addition, the tool integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 to offer personalized suggestions on how to fact-check the news.
